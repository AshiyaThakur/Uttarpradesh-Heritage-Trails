            <h2><u>The History of Uttar Pradesh</u></h2><br>
            <p class='spaced-lines'>
                The history of Uttar Pradesh is very ancient and interesting. It is recognised in the later Vedic Age as
                Brahmarshi Desha or Madhya Desha. Many great sages of the Vedic times like Bhardwaja, Gautam, Yagyavalkaya,
                Vashishtha, Vishwamitra, and Valmiki flourished in this state. Several sacred books of the Aryans were also
                composed here. Two great epics of India, Ramayana and Mahabharata, appear to have been inspired by Uttar Pradesh.
                In the sixth century B.C., Uttar Pradesh was associated with two new religions - Jainism and Buddhism.
                It was at Sarnath that Buddha preached his first sermon and laid the foundations of his order, and it
                was in Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh, where Buddha breathed his last. Several centers in Uttar Pradesh like
                Ayodhya, Prayag, Varanasi, and Mathura became reputed centers of learning. In the medieval period, Uttar Pradesh
                passed under Muslim rule and led the way to a new synthesis of Hindu and Islamic cultures. Ramananda and his Muslim
                disciple Kabir, Tulsidas, Surdas, and many other intellectuals contributed to the growth of Hindi and other languages.
                Uttar Pradesh preserved its intellectual excellence even under the British administration.
                The British combined Agra and Oudh into one province and called it the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. 
                The name was shortened to the United Provinces in 1935. In January 1950, the United Provinces were renamed as 
                Uttar Pradesh.
                The State is bound by Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh in the north, Haryana in the west, Madhya Pradesh in the 
                South and Bihar in the east. Uttar Pradesh can be divided into two distinct regions: Southern Hills and Gangetic Plain.

                UP Power Corporation, UP State Power Generation and UP Hydel Power Corporation had been formed by reorganising UP
                State Electricity Board on 14 January 2000. During 2001-02 the total installation capacity was 4659 MW, in 2006-07

                lakh KW and in the year 2006-07 it was 229692 which at present 227099 during the year 2007-08. The total consumption 
                of power during the year 2001-02 was 253301 lakh KW.
                Power is an important input to accelerate the process of economic growth. The installed capacity of re-organized
